The Stock market forecasters focus on developing a successful approach to predict stock prices. The vital idea to successful stock market prediction is not only achieving best results but also to minimize the inaccurate forecast of stock market crash prediction. This paper attempts to design and implement a predictive system for guiding stock market investment. The novelty of our approach is the combination of both Machine learning model for prediction of stock market crash and Sentiment Analysis of twitter news feed.

In the prediction of stock market analysis a new novel approach is proposed to predict the buy or sell signal  to  the  investors.  In  the  proposed  approach stock market forecasting is  achieved by combining both stock related indicators from yahoo finance and sentiment analysis of twitter feed.

The LPPL model is used for crash prediction which will help in determining whether the crash is going to happen or not; this is supported with confidence score of the output. The critical time of the crash is also predicted through this model. This model uses Machine Learning to predict the crash prediction, critical time of crash, positive and negative bubbles on stock market. Live data of the top twenty companies's stock is fed to model along with the financial indicators present in yahoo finance. 

Sentiment classification could  be done in word/phrase  level, sentence  level and document level.  Sentiment  analysis  has  now  become  the dominant  approach  used  for  extracting  sentiment and  appraisals  from  online  sources.  Subjectivity analysis and polarity analysis focuses on dividing language units into two categories:  objective  and  subjective,  whereas sentiment analysis  attempts to  divide the language units  into three  categories; negative,  positive,  and neutral. 
Two types of results are achieved in the proposed system.  One  is  without  sentiment,  the  LPPL Model is calculated and second  one is with sentiment analysis. Both the results  will  show  the  improvements  in  the  stock
